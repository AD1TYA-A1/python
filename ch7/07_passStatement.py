# "pass"----> is a null statement in python
# It instructs to "do Nothing"


# Suppose I want a group project and my friend will work on a for loop later sooo I can use a passs statement to continue the execution of remaning program

for i in range(1, 5):
    pass  # Used when I need to work on this for loop later

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
